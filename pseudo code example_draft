The request for this code: Choose the newspapers in an alphabetical order from A-Z.

Write "enter the name of the newspaper"

READ "title"
IF ("title"A)
		Print "title" A
ELSE 
	Dispaly "No newspapers found starting with A"

	ENDIF;


	OR A simple example of pseudo code:

	In this pseudo code:
	We start by initializing a list of newspapers titles; "newpaperList"
	We use a FOR loop to iterate through each title in the list.
	within the loop, we use an IF-statement to check if the firts letter starts with an "A".
	If the condition in line 4 is true, we print the newspaper in line 5.

	this pseudo code will print all the newspaper titles that starts with "A" on separate lines within a single loop. It displays each matching titles as it encounters them in the "newspaperList".

	1. Start
	2. initialize a list of newspaper titles (letÂ´s call it "newspaperList)
	3. FOR each newspaper title in "newspaperList" DO
	4. IF the first letter of the newspaper title is "A" THEN
	5. 		Print the newspaper title
	6. 	ENDIF
	7. END FOR
	8. End

OR!!

1. Start
2. Initialize an empty list to store newspaper titles starting with 'A' (let's call it 'foundNewspapers').
3. Initialize a list of newspaper titles (let's call it 'newspaperList').

4. FOR each newspaper title in 'newspaperList' DO
5.     IF the first letter of the newspaper title is 'A' THEN
6.         Add the newspaper title to 'foundNewspapers'.
7.     END IF
8. END FOR

9. IF 'foundNewspapers' is not empty THEN
10.    Sort 'foundNewspapers' in alphabetical order.
11.    Display "Newspapers starting with 'A':"
12.    FOR each newspaper title in 'foundNewspapers' DO
13.        Display the newspaper title.
